# RecruitAIr

**RecruitAIr** is an AI-powered recruiter assistant built for the **Cognee Hackathon**.

Unlike traditional Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS), RecruitAIr doesn't just filter resumes using keywords—it builds persistent memory of candidates and recruiter preferences using **Cognee**. Over time, it learns how recruiters make hiring decisions and provides increasingly personalized candidate recommendations.
